Instructions for Using Git:
Download the Python Script:

Download the Python script (xyz.py) from the repository or provided link.
Prepare the Input File:

First, copy all the links from the FitGirl Repack Pastebin.
Paste all these links into a text file, which will be named input_files.txt.
Ensure that this file is placed in the same directory where you downloaded the Python script.
Install Git and Python Dependencies:

If you don't have Git installed, download and install it from the official Git website.
Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script.
Install the necessary Python libraries by running:
Copy code
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
Run the Script:

In the terminal, navigate to the directory where the xyz.py file and input_files.txt are located.
Run the script using the following command:
Copy code
python xyz.py
The script will extract the links and save them in a file called extracted_links.txt.
Download the Links Using IDM:

Open IDM (Internet Download Manager).
Go to the Tasks tab and click on Import.
Select the extracted_links.txt file and click OK.
Your download task will be added and ready for use.
